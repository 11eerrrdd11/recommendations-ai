# Shopify Recommendations Ai

## Client setup

- Create a private app for your shopify store
- Set up Google Cloud Platform
    - Sign up for GCP
    - Add a billing account
    - Create a new project
    - Link your billing account to the project
    - Add contractor to project with the following roles

## Deploy recommendations Ai backend

- Install Google Cloud Platform CLI and authenticate
- Select GCP project

```bash
    export PROJECT_ID=<YOUR PROJECT ID>
    gcloud config set project ${PROJECT_ID}
```

- Enable the recommendations & retail APIs

```bash
    gcloud services enable recommendationengine.googleapis.com
    gcloud services enable retail.googleapis.com
```

- Initialize the firebase project. Make sure to select GCP project and enable only required resources. The only file that shoudl change is `.firebaserc`.

```bash
    firebase init
```

- On the recs AI dashboard in GCP
    - create an unregistered API key to log user events
    - create a registered API key to request predictions

- Set environment variables

```bash
export RECS_EVENT_KEY=<your recs event key>
export RECS_PREDICT_KEY=<your predict key>
export SHOPIFY_URL=<your website homepage>
export SHOPIFY_SHOP_NAME=<your shop name>
export SHOPIFY_API_KEY=<your private app api key>
export SHOPIFY_APP_PASSWORD=<your private app password>
export SHOPIFY_CURRENCY_CODE=<currency code for products in shopify admin console>
export SHOPIFY_WEBHOOK_SECRET=<from settings > notifications > webhooks>
```

- Configure firebase

```bash
firebase functions:config:set shopify.webhook_secret=${SHOPIFY_WEBHOOK_SECRET} shopify.currency_code=${SHOPIFY_CURRENCY_CODE} shopify.url=${SHOPIFY_URL} shopify.shop_name=${SHOPIFY_SHOP_NAME} shopify.api_key=${SHOPIFY_API_KEY} shopify.password=${SHOPIFY_APP_PASSWORD} recs.event_key=${RECS_EVENT_KEY} recs.predict_key=${RECS_PREDICT_KEY}

firebase functions:config:get > ./functions/.runtimeconfig.json
```

- Deploy cloud functions for shopify catalog syncing, event logging and predictions requests

```bash
firebase deploy --only functions
```

- Trigger your first catalog update (gcp > cloud scheduler > run)
- Add webhooks (shopify > settings > notifications > webhooks) for cart creation, cart update and order payment

## Phase 1 - record user events on your shopify storefront

- Go to store > themes > edit theme code
- Paste the following code directly under the <head> tag in your theme.liquid file

```html
<!-- Google Analytics & uid tracking -->
<script>
(function(i,s,o,g,r,a,m){i['GoogleAnalyticsObject']=r;i[r]=i[r]||function(){
(i[r].q=i[r].q||[]).push(arguments)},i[r].l=1*new Date();a=s.createElement(o),
m=s.getElementsByTagName(o)[0];a.async=1;a.src=g;m.parentNode.insertBefore(a,m)
})(window,document,'script','https://www.google-analytics.com/analytics.js','ga');

ga('create', '<GOOGLE ANALYTICS ID>', 'auto');
ga('set', 'userId', '{{customer.id}}');
</script>

<!-- PERSONALIZATION - install Optimizely-->
<script src="https://unpkg.com/@optimizely/optimizely-sdk@3.5/dist/optimizely.browser.umd.min.js"></script>
<script src="https://cdn.optimizely.com/datafiles/UxFYZqB5NpjGBo6f84uCE.json/tag.js"></script>
```

- Paste the following code under the <body> tag in your theme.liquid

```html
<!-- PERSONALIZATION - instantiate optimizely -->
<script>
var optimizelyClientInstance = optimizelySdk.createInstance({
    datafile: window.optimizelyDatafile,
});
</script>
```

- Add `./shopify_scripts/recommendation_events.js` & `./shopify_scripts/recommendation_requests.js` to the `assets` directory of your theme
- Update cloud function urls in javascript files to match your deployed functions
- Load the new javascript assets in your `theme.liquid` file under `<script src="{{ 'theme.js' | asset_url }}" defer="defer"></script>`

```html
<script src="{{ 'recommendations_events.js' | asset_url }}" onload="pageVisit()"></script>
<script src="{{ 'recommendations_requests.js' | asset_url }}"></script>
```
- Log the following user events from your theme code

- [x] detail-page-view (product.liquid)
- [x] home-page-view (index.liquid)
- [x] checkout-start (`onClick` to checkout button)
- [x] category-page-view (collection.liquid)
- [x] search (search.liquid)
- [x] shopping-cart-page-view (cart.liquid and delayed onclick if dynamic drawer)

## Phase 2 - serve recommendations in the customer journey

- After 7 days you will have enough data to train models
- Have a front end developer add code to your theme to request and serve recommendations in the customer journey. You can use the functions in recommendation_requests.js to get predictions.

## Comparison

|       | Ollie | Certona | Shopify |
|-------|-------|---------|
| Setup | non-technical DIY in <10 mins | Contact team for custom integration | no setup |
| Price | $X per recommendations request (eg $150/month @ 60,000 sessions/month) | $10000's/month | free |
| Max products | unlimited | unlimited | 5000 |
| Types of recs | home, pdp, cart, recently viewed | home, pdp, cart, recently viewed| pdp, recently viewed |
| Custom user & product features | yes | yes | no |

## Thoughts

- Clients are bad at even simple tasks like setting up a GCP account with billing
- Some clients will have insufficient data to train models. Looks like Hexxee is on track to train *recommended for you* after 7 days.

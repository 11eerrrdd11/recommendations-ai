# Shopify Recommendations Ai

## Prerequisites

- Install Google Cloud Platform CLI and authenticate
- Create a private app for your shopify store

## Setup Google Cloud Infrastructure

- Create and enable a new project

```bash
    export PROJECT_ID=recommendations-ai-1234
    gcloud projects create ${PROJECT_ID} --name recommendations-ai 
    gcloud config set project ${PROJECT_ID}
```

- Link a billing account in the console
- Enable the recommendations api

```bash
    gcloud services enable recommendationengine.googleapis.com
```

- [Create a service account in the GCP console](https://cloud.google.com/recommendations-ai/docs/setting-up#service-account)
- On the recs AI dashboard
    - create an unregistered API key to log user events
    - create a registered API key to request predictions
- Initialize firebase and select your project

```bash
    firebase init
```

- Set environment variables for your project

```bash
export RECS_EVENT_KEY=<your recs event key>
export RECS_PREDICT_KEY=<your predict key>
export SHOPIFY_URL=<your website homepage>
export SHOPIFY_SHOP_NAME=<your shop name>
export SHOPIFY_API_KEY=<your private app api key>
export SHOPIFY_APP_PASSWORD=<your private app password>
export SHOPIFY_CURRENCY_CODE=<currency code for products in shopify admin console>
export ACCESS_TOKEN=<your default application token>

firebase functions:config:set shopify.url=${SHOPIFY_URL} shopify.shop_name=${SHOPIFY_SHOP_NAME} shopify.api_key=${SHOPIFY_API_KEY} shopify.password=${SHOPIFY_APP_PASSWORD} recs.event_key=${RECS_EVENT_KEY} recs.predict_key=${RECS_PREDICT_KEY} gcp.default_access_token=${ACCESS_TOKEN}
firebase functions:config:get > .runtimeconfig.json
```

- Deploy cloud functions for shopify catalog syncing, event logging and predictions requests

```bash
firebase deploy --only functions
```

## Record user events on your shopify storefront

- Go to store > themes > edit theme code
- Paste our google analytics tracking code directly under the <head> tag in your theme.liquid file

```html
<!-- Google Analytics & uid tracking -->
<script>
(function(i,s,o,g,r,a,m){i['GoogleAnalyticsObject']=r;i[r]=i[r]||function(){
(i[r].q=i[r].q||[]).push(arguments)},i[r].l=1*new Date();a=s.createElement(o),
m=s.getElementsByTagName(o)[0];a.async=1;a.src=g;m.parentNode.insertBefore(a,m)
})(window,document,'script','https://www.google-analytics.com/analytics.js','ga');

ga('create', '<GOOGLE ANALYTICS ID>', 'auto');
ga('set', 'userId', '{{customer.id}}'); // Set the user ID using signed-in user_id.
</script>
```

- Add `./shopify_scripts/recommendation_events.js` & `./shopify_scripts/recommendation_requests.js` to the `assets` directory in your theme
- Load the new javascript assets in your `theme.liquid` file under `<script src="{{ 'theme.js' | asset_url }}" defer="defer"></script>`

```html
<script src="{{ 'recommendations_events.js' | asset_url }}" onload="pageVisit()"></script>
<script src="{{ 'recommendations_requests.js' | asset_url }}"></script>
```
- Log all kinds of user events in your theme code (see ToDo section below)
- Deploy event logging code and wait 1 week to record data
- Create models in recommendations Ai dashboard
